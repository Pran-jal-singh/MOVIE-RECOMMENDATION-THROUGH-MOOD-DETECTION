# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-THROUGH-MOOD-DETECTION
In this project, we aim to develop an intelligent system that can recommend movies based on the user's mood. We all have experienced situations where we feel sad, happy, or excited and want to watch a movie that fits our mood perfectly. 
The project is based on the idea of creating a personalized movie recommendation system that can understand the user's emotions and preferences.
