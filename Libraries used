#Libraries used...
Here we have used various python libraries such as open cv,  TensorFlow, keras, Numpy, matplotlib, nltk, etc. to make the model.
As there was no available database available, we have used Python web scraping to get the required data. This is implemented using beautifulsoup4.
Python web scraping is an automated method used for collecting large amounts of data from websites and storing it in a structured form .
For making the GUI of the project we have used the Tkinter. Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). 
For mood detection we have used OpenCV along with other libraries and database is taken from Kaggle.
